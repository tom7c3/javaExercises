Build a module of a application that allows you to find the nearest texi in a city. The list of nearest taxi may change depending on the motion of the taxi and on availability (taxi may be dispatched to other customers). Implement the logic that finds nearest taxi at any point in time.
Business Requirements:
1.            There are a large but finite number of taxi in the city.
2.            The customer is only interested in taxi within a radius of 1 km.
3.            There are a maximum number of taxi that can be returned to the user at any time.
4.            The position and availability of individual taxi will naturally change over time. The program should be able to efficiently determine the set of nearest taxi at any given moment
5.            The userâ€™s position does not change.
